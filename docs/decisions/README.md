# Decision log

One file per decision that was hard to make or would otherwise be re-argued every fortnight.

**Why bother.** Two reasons. Practically, it stops "why is everything in millimetres?" coming back
every sprint. For the unit, the Individual Reflective Report has to explicitly refer to artefacts,
and a dated record of a decision you argued for is far better evidence than a memory in November.

## Writing one

Copy the shape of an existing file. Number it next in sequence, keep it short, and put the reasoning
in, not just the conclusion. A decision with no "why" is worthless six weeks later.

Statuses: **proposed**, **accepted**, **superseded by ADR-NNNN**.

Never edit an accepted decision to change its meaning. Write a new one that supersedes it and mark
the old one. The trail of what we changed our minds about is the useful part.
